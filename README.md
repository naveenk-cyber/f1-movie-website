### ✅ Important tip (very important)
Right now, **your HTML file contains TWO pages in one file** ❌  
For GitHub upload, do this:

- `index.html` → only the first page  
- `book.html` → only the booking page  

If you want, I can:
- Split your HTML correctly  
- Review it for errors  
- Improve README to portfolio level  
- Add screenshots section  

Just tell me 🚀
